            <h2>Using flutter and clever shader tricks to simulate 3D planets</h2>
            
            <p>Different from my other projects this one was a made as a piece of coursework for 
                University.
                This posed a new set of challeneges since we had to use <i>Dart</i>, <i>Flutter</i> and it had 
                to include a <i>database</i> like system. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I didn't initially settle on my idea but first experimented with flutter. This was my first time using
                the framework, and it seems very verbose when looking at some basic code. 
                I did want to see how far I could push it though. 
                And I found the perfect starting point when I discovered flutter gives access to fragment shaders. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With the knowledge I could access fragment shaders I had an idea. We can't send mesh information to the GPU
                without OpenGL or some other graphics API, and flutter doesn't expose any APIs like that <i>yet.</i>
                So to get 3D I had to do something else. That was: 
                <br><i><b>Raymarching</i></b><br>
                and other ray based rendering techniques using signed distence fields. 
            </p>

            <p>Just click <i>View Project</i> to view the web build of the app.</p>
