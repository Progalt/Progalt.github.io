            <h2>A personal challenge project to design a UI system and more</h2>
            <h3> - The beginnings</h3>
            <p>
                During the summer between my first and second year at University. I was a bit bored. 
                So I decided to try something I had wanted to try for a while. Writing a tool instead of 
                something video game based. I thought this would be valuable experience in making an application 
                that wasn't bound by video game performance concerns. I had been craving a different sort of challenge 
                for most of my first year of University, which was mostly basic projects in python. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I had grown a bit of a fascination with note tools like Obsidian, or Notion. So I decided to make a 
                note taking tool. I had about a month before University started back up, so that was the time frame. 
                An ambitious one, but I believed I could get something working in that time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose to do it in C++, and without a UI library like Qt, I would write the UI from scratch. 
                Would I do this for a proper project I would ship? No. Most UI libraries now are perfomant and well tested. 
                That is unless I wanted to dedicate a significant portion of time to developing a well planned out and tested 
                UI library. And that wasn't fully viable with the month or so I had. 
            </p>

            <p>
                With starting from the very little basic framework I had the first thing I needed to do was to get vertices on screen.
                Luckily I have experience with OpenGL, <i>Which is what I chose due to the time constraints</i>, and getting some batched 
                vertices with textures on screen wasn't difficult. <b><i>Then began the making of the UI...</i></b>
            </p>

            <h3> - Font Rendering</h3>

            <p>
                Font Rendering was something I had limited experience with in the past, which I suppose makes this project 
                a good choice for font rendering. Now I didn't want to use a bitmap font, so that leaves me with 
                <code>.ttf</code> or <code>.otf</code> fonts. FreeType was the library I chose to do the font rasterisation, 
                ttf parsing and rasterisation was far beyond the scope of the project.
