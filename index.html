                    <p>I've been teaching myself programming for years since I was around 13 and in 2022 actually began studying towards a 
                        BSc in Computer Science at the University of Portsmouth in the UK. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've always been really interested in the low level workings of computers and how code can make  them do stuff. 
                        How Compilers and Operating Systems work has been an interest of mine. Though apart from an interpreter I've never
                        written my own. Though I would like to in the future if I have time, especially a simple OS. I think that could be fun but also a long 
                        process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've also had a big interest in real-time 3D rendering, going ahead and implenting my own 3D renderers in <i>OpenGL</i> and <i>Vulkan</i>.
                        As well as this I have attempted multiple other aspects of game engine development. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like to try and push myself to create new different projects and learn new things, such as UI development from the ground up. 
                        Or learning new languages like Dart. But most of my personal projects are programmed in C++. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also really like to draw in my spare time, and when I'm not programming you can probably find me sketching something... or playing video games.
