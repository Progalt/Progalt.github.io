            <h1>About Me.</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Henry Gronow and I'm a CS student at the University of Portsmouth. I have a keen interest in Game Engine development and Graphics Programming. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always been interested in low level programming, opting to use C/C++ in my personal projects and always wanting to understand how code interacts with
                the underlying hardware. I've written my own memory allocators, my own parsers and my own simple interpreter for a very basic language. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest always falls back to game engines, they combine many different things into one big project. 
                Whether this be graphics rendering, memory management or interacting with the OS. 
            </p>
